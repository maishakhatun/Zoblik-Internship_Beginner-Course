# Exercise 1: List Creation and Access
#Let's say Zoblik needs a quick list of employees for a team meeting.

# Create a list of team members for Zoblik's marketing department
marketing_team = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve","Adam"]

# Print the entire team list
print(f"Full Marketing Team: {marketing_team}")

# Access and print the first team member
first_member = marketing_team[2]
print(f"The first member is: {first_member}")

# Access and print the last team member using negative indexing
last_member = marketing_team[-1]
print(f"The last member is: {last_member}")
